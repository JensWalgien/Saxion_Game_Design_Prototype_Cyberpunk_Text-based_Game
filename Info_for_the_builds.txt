To play the builds you need to download them on an android

It's a text-based game but the text is limit.
Not every choice will take you deeper into the story.
I recommend to take the girl path that one goes the furthest.
Until you get to the part were you get the choices 
	Loop your arm through hers as you walk
	Stroll next to each other
	Beat her to the meeting

That is the end of all the text
